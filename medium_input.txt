stateless-me/uuidv47
UUIDv47 combines the privacy benefits of UUIDv4 with the sortability and performance of UUIDv7. Standard UUIDv7 includes a timestamp that can leak timing information, while UUIDv4 is random but not sortable. UUIDv47 offers a middle ground by providing chronological ordering without exposing precise creation times.
