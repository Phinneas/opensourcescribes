# OpenSourceScribes Style & Voice Guide

This document defines the banned phrases and writing rules to prevent "AI-sounding" corny content across all generation scripts.

## 🚫 BANNED PHRASES (The "Cliche List")
Do NOT use these words or phrases under any circumstances:
- "Gems" or "Hidden Gems"
- "Supercharge"
- "Dive in" / "Deep dive" (unless specifically referring to the video category name)
- "Game changer" / "Revolutionary"
- "Look no further"
- "Unlock the potential" / "Unlock the power"
- "Elevate your workflow"
- "Buckle up"
- "Pique your interest"
- "Treasure trove"
- "Innovative" / "Cutting-edge" / "State of the art"
- "Think outside the box"
- "Seamlessly integrate"
- "At the end of the day"
- "Tired of X? Meet Y"
- "Ultimate guide"
- "Must-have"
- "Take a closer look"

## ✍️ WRITING RULES
1. **Concrete over Abstract**: Instead of saying a tool "supercharges your workflow," say "it automates your Docker deployments" or "it reduces build times by 30%."
2. **Short Sentences**: Force the AI to use simple subject-verb-object structures. Max 15 words per sentence.
3. **No Fluff**: Skip the "enthusiastic" filler. If a project is for managing Kubernetes, start by talking about Kubernetes, not how "excited" we are.
4. **Human Tone**: Write like a senior engineer explaining a tool to a teammate over coffee. No marketing speak. No "hype."
5. **Vary Structure**: Avoid starting every paragraph with "Project X is..."
